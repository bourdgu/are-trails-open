# Trails...are they open!?

Just a little Next.js practice, leveraging an existing API endpoint from [trailstatusapp.com](https://trailstatusapp.com/) // [jschr/trail-status-app](https://github.com/jschr/trail-status-app) for [The Hydrocut](https://www.thehydrocut.ca/) mountain biking trails, in Kitchener, Ontario.

## .env variables
- `TRAIL_NAME` - for the trail name, obviously.
- `TRAILSTATUS_API_ID` - trail id for trailstatusapp endpoint

## TODO
- handle regions/trails for partial open/close
- darkmode / toggle
